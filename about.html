        <p>Game developer that wants to make games that will leave people with a happy heart. <span class="heart" >♥</span></p>

        <p class="justified">
            Born in 1997 in the countryside of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, my first contact with programming was when I entered the Game Development course at Unisinos, on 2015, learning C++. This was responsible for all the passion I have for programming, the university gave me opportunities to try out a lot of areas. There I took part at a visualization laboratory, which, even though I don't like academic research, gave me great knowledge with OpenGL, and also <a href="http://www.atomicrocket.com.br/">Atomic Rocket Entertainment</a>, an experimental game development studio, which gave me first-hand experience with game development.
        </p>

        <p class="justified">
            Leaving university's ground, I worked with software engineering at <a href="http://owlbytes.com/">Owl Bytes</a>, developing an Android SDK in java for an international client. There I learned a lot about software managing, especially scrum, which, after few months, I was responsible for. It was a really great and different experience, but I wanted to get back to game development.
        </p>

        <p class="justified">  
            Nowadays I'm working making games at  <a href="https://babyowlstudios.com">Baby Owl Studios</a> while also finishing my graduation.
