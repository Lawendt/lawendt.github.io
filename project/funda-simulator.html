        <p>Funda Simulator is an arcade VR game where the player can remember the sweet sensation of shooting with a slingshoot without being repressed by destroying everything!</p>  
        <p>Best VR Game finalist on SBGames 2017. </p>  


        <p>I took part in the development, using Unity and VRTK, and also on the game design. It was developed while working on <a href="http://www.atomicrocket.com.br/">Atomic Rocket Entertainment</a></p>
